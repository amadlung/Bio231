Subject: Data Carpentry workshop at (XXX)

(XXX) will be hosting a Data Carpentry workshop for those working or interested in the field of Genomics on (XXX).

The Carpentries are a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they’ve learned to their own work. We are excited to teach the Genomics Carpentry curriculum here to help our students and researchers become more efficient in their work.

This workshop is focused on Genomics and the curriculum will include:

+ Assessing Read Quality
+ Trimming and Filtering
+ Variant Calling Workflow

The target audience is students (both undergraduate and graduate) who have little to no prior computational experience. The instructors will prioritize creating a friendly environment that will empower researchers and enable data-driven discovery. Even those with some experience will benefit, as the goal is to teach not only how to do analyses, but how to manage the process to make it as automated and reproducible as possible. For instance, participants will be introduced to:

+ Accessing Cloud Computing Resources
+ UNIX command line
+ Environment management using Conda & bioconda
+ Building Reproducible Workflows


Space is limited and it will likely fill quickly. The workshop is free however, registration is required and application form can be found here: .

The deadline to register is (XXX).

For more information please see the workshop website here: (XXX) or contact (XXX).edu or (XXX).edu for more information.

We hope to see you at the workshop!

Best,
